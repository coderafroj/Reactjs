🌟 About the Project

This repository is a high-level ReactJS playground designed to demonstrate modern web development with React. It includes advanced concepts like Hooks, Context API, Redux Toolkit, React Router, and TypeScript, along with practical projects like SPAs, dashboards, and e-commerce platforms. Whether you're a beginner or an expert, this repo offers something for everyone to learn and build upon.

Why this repo?





🧠 Deep dive into React's ecosystem with real-world examples.



📦 Reusable components for rapid development.



🎨 Beautiful UI/UX with Tailwind CSS and modern design principles.



🌐 Optimized for performance and scalability.



🔥 Features





Advanced Component Architecture: Modular and reusable components with prop drilling, Context, and Redux.



State Management: Implementations with useState, useReducer, Context API, and Redux Toolkit.



Routing: Dynamic navigation with React Router v6.



Type Safety: TypeScript integration for robust code.



Styling: Tailwind CSS and CSS-in-JS (Emotion) for stunning UIs.



Testing: Unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library.



CI/CD: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.



Custom Renderer: A unique custom rendering function (inspired by my learning journey) to mimic React's DOM manipulation.



🛠️ Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:





Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/coderafroj/reactjs.git
cd reactjs



Install dependencies:

npm install



Run the development server:

npm start

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.



Build for production:

npm run build

Note: Ensure you have Node.js (v16 or higher) installed.



🚀 Usage

This repository contains multiple React projects and examples. To explore:





Run a specific project: Navigate to a project folder (e.g., /projects/todo-app) and run:

npm start



Try the custom renderer: Check out the customreact.js file, which demonstrates a lightweight DOM renderer:

function customRender(reactElement, main) {
  const domElement = document.createElement(reactElement.type);
  domElement.innerHTML = reactElement.children;
  for (const prop in reactElement.props) {
    domElement.setAttribute(prop, reactElement.props[prop]);
  }
  main.appendChild(domElement);
}

const reactElement = {
  type: "a",
  props: {
    href: "https://google.com",
    target: "_blank"
  },
  children: "Click me to visit Google"
};

const main = document.querySelector("#root");
customRender(reactElement, main);



Explore components: Browse the /src/components folder for reusable UI components like buttons, modals, and cards.
